BitcoinPrice
============

A bitcoin price ticker for the terminal.

In order to use the app you first must install the dependency needed for colors

```
pip install termcolors
```
(Might need to run as root for some users, in that case just put "sudo" in front of the command)
A warning to Windows users, this won't work on your machine because the command prompt doesn't support colors.

After that just run the app like so:
```
cd /path/to/src/
python app.py
```

And WALA! Just watch the magic happen. The delay has been set to 2 seconds to avoid an api limit.

Donations are appreciated :)
